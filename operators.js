// this is most complex part of JS in my openion

// arithmetic op + - / * %

console.log(null == undefined); // true .. this allows type coercion
console.log(null === undefined); // false ..  checks type and value both

console.log(NaN == NaN); // false .... It just is ..... use isNaN() instead

//null == undefined is TRUE. (Memorize this).

//"5" == 5 is TRUE. (String becomes number).

//true == 1 is TRUE. (Boolean becomes number).

//[] == 0 is TRUE. (Array becomes empty string "", which becomes 0).
